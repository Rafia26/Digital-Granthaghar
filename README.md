# e-Granthagar: A Digital Library Management System  

e-Granthagar is a stand-alone application for both desktop and laptop users, for storing and keeping track of Librarians as well as books & novels in an organized and sophisticated manner. It is designed and developed in such a way as to maintain, organize, and handle countless books systematically. Not only does the system track the number of books available in the library but it  also issues books to users and automatically update the report date and time. Librarians will also be able to search any record of books by its category (i.e. ISBN, Author, Title, etc.). The most distinctive feature of the project is how it will reduce the manual labour burden of the librarians and replace paperworks. 

It consists of two separate panels, Admin and Librarian, who can login and logout using their specific username and password. Their tasks are as follows:

#### Admin’s Tasks:  
* Add new librarians.  
* View list of existing librarians.  
* Delete a particular librarian from the database.  

#### Librarian’s Tasks:  
* Add new books to the library database.  
* Store information (name, ISBN, etc) of upcoming books in the database.  
* View existing books in the library database.  
* Issue books to the users with automatic update of report date and time.  
* View which books are currently issued.  
* View a record history of all previously issued books.  
* Return a book that has been previously issued and auto updates the database on return.  
* Search for an existing book in the library database via author, title, ISBN, Bib Number, Publication Year, Publisher or Subjects.
